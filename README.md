# Campus Connect: Resource Location & Accessibility Platform

## Overview
Campus Connect is a mobile application designed to address spatial inequality on university campuses by helping students, especially first-generation and international students, locate and access vital resources. The app provides real-time information about study spaces, computer labs, food services, and campus events through an intuitive, multilingual interface with robust accessibility features.

Our solution tackles the challenges faced by students who lack familiarity with campus layouts, experience language barriers, or have limited support networks. By centralizing resource information and adding inclusive features, Campus Connect creates a more equitable campus experience for all students.

## User Research
Our design process was informed by research with first-generation and international students who identified key pain points:
- Difficulty finding available study spaces during peak times
- Language barriers when navigating traditional campus resources
- Challenges connecting with peers who share similar backgrounds
- Limited awareness of campus events and opportunities

User testing revealed that 85% of participants could locate resources faster using Campus Connect compared to existing methods, with particular appreciation for the multilingual support and real-time availability features.

## Process
1. **Problem Definition**: Identified spatial inequality issues affecting specific student populations
2. **User Research**: Conducted surveys and interviews with target stakeholders
3. **Feature Prioritization**: Determined most impactful features based on user needs
4. **Wireframing**: Created low-fidelity mockups for key user flows
5. **Visual Design**: Developed accessible, intuitive interface with consistent styling
6. **Prototyping**: Built interactive prototype for user testing
7. **Usability Testing**: Gathered feedback through mock user studies
8. **Iteration**: Refined design based on user insights

## Future Development
With additional resources, we plan to expand Campus Connect with:
- Support for additional languages beyond the current three
- Offline mode for areas with limited connectivity
- AI-powered personalized resource recommendations
- Cross-platform web version for non-mobile access
- Enhanced integration with university information systems
